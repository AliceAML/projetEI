# projetEI (Ecriture Inclusive)
Ongoing NLP project (February - June 2021) | First-year Linguistics & Computer science Master's Degree at Université de Paris

__Our goal__: automating French inclusive writing ("les étudiant·e·s" rathers than "les étudiants" for example).

- [ ] Creating an inclusive writing corpus
- [ ] Automatic tagging of tokens (EI/not EI)
- [ ] "de-inclusifying" the corpus to use it in a machine learning algorithm (minimum-edit distance)
- [ ] Machine learning: automatic tagging of nouns that should be rewritten (generic reference and/or references to mixed male/female groups)
- [ ] Coreference resolution: find coreference chains from those nouns
- [ ] Morphological modification of the tokens
